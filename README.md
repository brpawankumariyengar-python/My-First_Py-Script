# My-First_Py-Script
My very first Py-Script based GitHub
Python is now in your Browser

Finally it is here … The beginning of new era and end of Java Script perhaps ?

At last we have Python in our browser …. Let us all welcome “Py-Script”  

Now we can execute Python Scripts directly from our browser.  Thus we can add python coding into HTML and we no longer need web services to post our python based codes. 


To use the repository please download all the files into a single folder // directory and then run the HTML from there

It does not seem to work on Safari Browser due to the fact that py-script has been tested on Chrome only. However, it seems to be running great on Firefox as well.
